We are group of graduate students and professor associated with  together to read and understand the very recent papers related to *Theoretical and algorithmic aspects of nonlinear parameter estimation and deep learning*. The aim is to develop *rigourous* understanding of this budding field. One of us will take the lead in presenting the paper. The presenter would go in depth (understand and explain any proofs, etc.) The presenter would also post notes on the paper prior to the meeting.

We meet twice a week. Currently, our plan is limited to Summer 2017 only.
Please see our [Reading list](https://virajshah018.github.io/reading/) and [Schedule](https://virajshah018.github.io/schedule/) page for more details.
Details about upcoming meets are posted on [Home](http://virajshah018.github.io).

The group is open for grad students/researchers/professors. Please send an email to [Viraj](http://virajshah978.github.io) at <viraj@iastate.edu> if interested.
