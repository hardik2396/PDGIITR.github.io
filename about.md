One of us will take the lead in presenting the paper. The presenter would go in depth (understand and explain any proofs, etc.) The presenter would also post notes on the paper prior to the meeting.

We meet twice a week.Please see our [Reading list](https://virajshah018.github.io/reading/) and [Schedule](https://virajshah018.github.io/schedule/) page for more details.
